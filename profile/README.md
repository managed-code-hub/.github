## Hello! üëã
We are a team of developers based in Ukraine and France üá∫üá¶üá´üá∑ who love working with C#. We feel that the open source community needs more high-quality C# projects, and that many existing projects could benefit from active maintenance and updates. We believe in the power of open source software and strive to create and maintain high-quality projects for the C# and .NET communities.

Our mission is to bring more good C# projects to the world and to provide ongoing maintenance for new or existing projects that have not been updated in a long time. 

That's why we've dedicated ourselves to developing and maintaining open source code projects. We want to share our expertise and experience with the community.

We're also committed to training and hiring young specialists in the field. We believe that investing in the next generation of developers is key to the continued growth and success of the .NET communities.

## Our Projects üë∑
Here are some of the projects that we're currently working on:
- [**Storage**](https://github.com/managedcode/Storage): library provides a universal interface for accessing and manipulating data in different cloud blob storage providers. It makes it easy to switch between providers or to use multiple providers simultaneously, without having to learn and use multiple APIs.
- [**Database**](https://github.com/managedcode/Database): Unified interface for working with a variety of different document-oriented NoSQL databases.
- [**TimeSeries**](https://github.com/managedcode/TimeSeries) : Library provides convenient tools for working with time series data in C#. Its accumulators and summers make it easy to add and summarize data in time frames, and its efficient storage and compression capabilities ensure.
- [**Communication**](https://github.com/managedcode/Communication): provides a convenient and easy-to-use solution for handling the result of a function that may throw exceptions. It eliminates the need to handle exceptions and makes it easy to check whether the function was successful and to access its output.
- [**MimeType**](https://github.com/managedcode/MimeTypes): provides a convenient way to work with MIME types in C#. It defines a set of properties for each MIME type, allowing you to use properties instead of strings in your code.
- [**EnvironmentDetector**](https://github.com/managedcode/EnvironmentDetector): is a library that provides a simple way to detect whether your code is running in a test environment or not. It currently supports detecting Dapr, Kubernetes, Docker, MSTest, NUnit, and xUnit.
- [**OpenAI**](https://github.com/managedcode/OpenAI): This is an unofficial C# library for the OpenAI API. As there are no official libraries available, we have created our own to help C# developers interact with the API easily.



## MS Orleans related Projects üòé
Here are some of the projects that we're currently working on specifically related to Orleans:
- [**Orleans.Indexing**](https://github.com/managedcode/Orleans.Indexing): Orleans.Indexing is a library that provides functionality for searching Orleans grains by their states. It uses the powerful Lucene.NET library for indexing and searching grain states, making it easy to quickly retrieve data from grains.
- [**Orleans.Identity**](https://github.com/managedcode/Orleans.Identity): This is an authentication and authorization library for ASP.NET Identity based on Orleans. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage user sessions and authentication for your ASP.NET applications.
- [**Orleans.Balancer**](https://github.com/managedcode/Orleans.Balancer): Library for automatically balancing the number of active Grains in an Orleans. It allows you to set limits on the number of active Grains, and will automatically deactivate Grains if those limits are reached. It can also perform rebalancing of Grain activations between silos to ensure evenly distributed.
- [**Keda**](https://github.com/managedcode/Keda): Use KEDA autoscaling to automatically scale applications based on metrics such as the number of active Grains in Orleans, the number of API requests, and the number of SignalR connections. This allows your .NET applications to handle increased workloads without manual intervention.
of Grain activations between silos to ensure evenly distributed.
- [**Orleans.PushNotifications**](https://github.com/managedcode/Orleans.PushNotifications): Apple and Google Push notifications for Orleans.
- [**Orleans.RateLimiting**](https://github.com/managedcode/Orleans.RateLimiting): This is a library for Microsoft Orleans that provides a set of rate limiting algorithms for controlling the flow of requests in your distributed applications. It is designed to be easy to use and to integrate with your Orleans-based applications seamlessly.
- [**Orleans.SignalR**](https://github.com/managedcode/Orleans.SignalR): is a lightweight, open-source library that enables easy integration of SignalR with Orleans, a distributed virtual actor model framework for building scalable, fault-tolerant systems. The library provides a SignalR backplane, allowing you to effortlessly add real-time communication capabilities to your distributed systems.

## GitHub Actions ü¶æ
- [**MAUIAppVersion**](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/mauiappversion): This action updates the application version and/or display version properties in a .cproj file for a MAUI application. You can use this action as part of your CI/CD workflow to automatically update the version properties when building and publishing your MAUI application.
