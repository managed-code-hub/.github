## Hi! ðŸ‘‹
We are a team of developers based in Ukraine and France ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· who love working with C# and .NET. We feel that the open source community needs more high-quality C# projects, and that many existing projects could benefit from active maintenance and updates. We believe in the power of open source software and strive to create and maintain high-quality projects for the C# and .NET communities.

Our mission is to bring more good C# projects to the world and to provide ongoing maintenance for new or existing projects that have not been updated in a long time. 

That's why we've dedicated ourselves to developing and maintaining open source code projects for C# and .NET. We want to share our expertise and experience with the community, and to help make C# and .NET even better.

We're also committed to training and hiring young specialists in the field. We believe that investing in the next generation of developers is key to the continued growth and success of the C# and .NET communities.

## Hiring
We are always looking for talented C# and .NET developers to join our team. If you are interested in working with us, please check our website for current job openings and application instructions.

## Our Projects ðŸ‘·
Here are some of the projects that we're currently working on:

- [TimeSeries](https://github.com/managedcode/TimeSeries) : Library provides convenient tools for working with time series data in C#. Its accumulators and summers make it easy to add and summarize data in time frames, and its efficient storage and compression capabilities ensure.
- [Communication](https://github.com/managedcode/Communication): provides a convenient and easy-to-use solution for handling the result of a function that may throw exceptions. It eliminates the need to handle exceptions and makes it easy to check whether the function was successful and to access its output.
- [Storage](https://github.com/managedcode/Storage): library provides a universal interface for accessing and manipulating data in different cloud blob storage providers. It makes it easy to switch between providers or to use multiple providers simultaneously, without having to learn and use multiple APIs.


We're always working on new projects, so be sure to check our GitHub profile regularly for updates.
